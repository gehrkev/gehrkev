### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 29 y/o brazilian guy trying some code stuff. I'm a relatively new programmer, having almost two year of coding experience, but I tinkered with digital systems ever since I got my first PC as a kid, frying up and bricking some equipment on the process, but I also tweaked bits and pieces of code or the systems for my liking.

#### Stuff I may know something about:

- java, c, python, html+css+js/ts
- [pl/]sql - oracle & postgresql
- jasper reports
- shellscript
- git
- maven
- spring, hibernate, angular frameworks
- REST and SOAP services
- SOLID design
- windows & *nix (debian, ubuntu, arch, manjaro, fedora, freebsd)

I've also taken some Industrial Engineering classes so I'm knowledgeable about the managerial system
