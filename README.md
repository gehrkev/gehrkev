### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 30 y/o brazilian guy trying some code stuff. 
Ever since I was a small kid, technology was a big part of my life, as I got my first video-game console and computer, which I ended up frying or bricking while I experimented with them. Along the way I learned how to tweak bits and pieces of code or systems data, so the natural conclusion was becoming a software engineer.
Having over two years of professional experience at Senior Sistemas as a software developer, I customized their WMS (Warehouse Management System) according to each clients' needs and also worked with the integration of Senior's logistics products (including TMS, YMS and WMS) to other clients' software like an ERP.

#### Stuff I may know something about:

- java (professionally/education), c (education), rust, go, python, js & ts (hobby)
- [pl/]sql - oracle (professionally), mysql & postgres (education/hobby)
- jasper reports (professionally)
- REST and SOAP services
- SOLID design
- windows, mac & *nix (debian, ubuntu, arch, fedora, freebsd)
- clean code enthusiast, not a zealot
- how to quit vim and a bit more

I've also taken some Industrial Engineering classes so I'm knowledgeable about the managerial system.
