### Salutations! ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vitor, I'm a 28 y/o brazilian guy trying some code stuff, I don't really know much, although I've recently been on Java-oriented training and I just looked over some (really basic) C things in college and Python on my own.

#### Stuff I may or not know about:

- java, c, python, html+css+js/ts
- [pl/]sql - oracle & postgresql
- shellscript
- git
- eclipse & vscode IDEs
- maven
- spring, hibernate, angular frameworks
- REST services
- windows & gnu/linux (ubuntu, arch, manjaro, maybe fedora), I might try out freebsd soon

#### Talk to me about:

- weeb and humanities stuff (philosophy, history, psychology, languages); 
- crypto, the amazing place known as the internet and its impact on people, design, devops, free software;
- metroidvanias & roguelike games;
- coding in general, I guess
