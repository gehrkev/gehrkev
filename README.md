### Salutations! 👋

Name's Vitor, I'm 27 a y/o brazilian guy trying some code stuff, I don't really know much, although I'm currently on a Java training and I just looked over some (really basic) C things in college and Python on my own.

#### Stuff I may or not know about:

- java
- c
- python
- git
- eclipse
- maven
- spring
- REST services
- windows (duh)
- gnu/linux (ubuntu, arch, manjaro, maybe fedora)

#### Talk to me about:

- weeb and humanities stuff (philosophy, history, psychology, languages); 
- crypto, the amazing place known as the internet and its impact on people, design, devops, free software;
- metroidvanias & roguelike games;
- coding in general, I guess
