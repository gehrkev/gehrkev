### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vitor, I'm 27 a y/o brazilian guy trying some code stuff, I don't really know much, though I'm currently on a Java training and I just looked over some (really basic) C things on college and Python on my own.

Talk to me about:

- weeb and humanities stuff (philodophy, history, psychology, languages) ; 
- crypto, design, devops, free software;
- metroidvanias & roguelike games;
